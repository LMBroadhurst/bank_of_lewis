## Key Websites for App use

After entering and running the BolApplication file on port 8080...

### H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
- Easier cross compatibility vs. Postgres, wanted others to view the app as easily as possible
- username/password set as sa/password --> can be changed in application.properties if desired

### SwaggerUI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
- Similar to Postman functionality wise
- Improves UX by displaying the available API calls and templating what variables/bodies are required

## How to use the H2 console

Follow the link provided above, you should then be greeted with the following screen.

![H2 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199006917-1b6d1435-36e4-4dcf-9f94-cc3b7f96ffd0.jpg)

Enter the details as shown, the password is password and can be changed in application.properties.

After clicking connect you will be presented with this screen.
From here you can click the + to see the columns of the table & run any SQL statements you desire.

![H2 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199006946-0570939f-dcd8-4ac3-887d-169a5b8b32a7.jpg)

If you click directly on ATM you will get an autogenerated 'SELECT * FROM ATM' statement.

In the text box you may enter whatever SQL you like, for example 'SELECT NAME, LOCATION FROM ATM WHERE NOTE50 < 10'.

Here's some SQL to get you started:

```
INSERT INTO ATM (NAME, LOCATION, NOTE20, NOTE50) VALUES ('London1', 'Oxford St', 100, 200);
INSERT INTO ATM (NAME, LOCATION, NOTE20, NOTE50) VALUES ('London2', 'Liverpool St', 10, 5);
INSERT INTO ATM (NAME, LOCATION, NOTE20, NOTE50) VALUES ('London3', 'St Pauls', 5, 10);
INSERT INTO ATM (NAME, LOCATION, NOTE20, NOTE50) VALUES ('London4', 'Mahi Test', 8, 3);
```

## How to use SwaggerUI

The landing page after following the swagger link should show a list of potential API calls, as seen below.

![Swagger 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199007316-dbdfe8ac-c4ea-4435-8bb3-7ed4f1a00122.png)

To make a request, click on 'Try it out' in the top right hand corner of the API request, after clicking on the request.

![Swagger 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199007655-4bf77a90-08fb-4985-a01e-c5753824a70a.png)

Here we are going to attemp to withdraw $200 from the Mahi Test ATM by filling out the relevant fields and clicking execute.

![Swagger 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199008328-d55d8547-28e7-45f2-a328-7b000ee17a5f.png)

We get a 200 reponse code, and a response body stating "5 $20 notes dispensed. 2 $50 notes dispensed."

All other requests follow the same process.

## High level overview of App

Before coding the app, I planned to create a Spring Boot application that interacted with a DB.

After reading the spec required, I wrote an outline for a basic class diagram, seen below.

![pre code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199010137-11551097-33b8-43ac-9499-58d846383250.png)

## App Features
- ATMs have a supply of bank notes available.
- ATM knows the amount of each note it holds.
- ATM can report how many of each note it has, as well as it's total cash holding.
- ATM can tell it has x $20 and y $50 notes from the POST createAtm method.
- After initialisation, can only add or remove $20 and $50 notes.
- Errors reported when asking for invalid cash withdrawals, e.g. $30.
- Dispensing money removes the equivalent cash from the machine.
- Failure to dispense cash will not reduce the cash in the machine.
- ATM can dispense any valid match of $20s/$50s. As well as e.g. $200 when there are only 3x$50 notes and 8x$20 notes (see Mahi Test, ID 4 on given SQL).
- Requests of e.g. $100, $120 can dispense the maximum number of $20s possible by specifying the prefers20s parameter as true when withdrawing cash.
- The ATM will print a SOUT message when the number of a specific note in the ATM is below 10. It will also send a notification when the notes hit 0.
- The DB storing the relevant ATM information is persistent. The information will remain in the DB after closing and re-opening the app.
- Notes can be added to the machine number by using the addCash API request.
- Service/Controller/Repo layer testing.
