## Key Websites for App use

After entering and running the BolApplication file on port 8080...

### H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
- Easier cross compatibility vs. Postgres, wanted others to view the app as easily as possible
- username/password set as sa/password --> can be changed in application.properties if desired

### SwaggerUI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
- Similar to Postman functionality wise
- Improves UX by displaying the available API calls and templating what variables/bodies are required

## How to use the H2 console

Follow the link provided above, you should then be greeted with the following screen.

Enter the details as shown, the password is password and can be changed in application.properties.

After clicking connect you will be presented with this screen.
From here you can click the + to see the columns of the table & run any SQL statements you desire.

![H2 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199006946-0570939f-dcd8-4ac3-887d-169a5b8b32a7.jpg)

If you click directly on ATM you will get an autogenerated 'SELECT * FROM ATM' statement.

In the text box you may enter whatever SQL you like, for example 'SELECT NAME, LOCATION FROM ATM WHERE NOTE50 < 10'.

## How to use SwaggerUI

The landing page after following the swagger link should show a list of potential API calls, as seen below.

![Swagger 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199007316-dbdfe8ac-c4ea-4435-8bb3-7ed4f1a00122.png)

To make a request, click on 'Try it out' in the top right hand corner of the API request, after clicking on the request.

![Swagger 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199007655-4bf77a90-08fb-4985-a01e-c5753824a70a.png)

Here we are going to attemp to withdraw $200 from the Mahi Test ATM by filling out the relevant fields and clicking execute.

![Swagger 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95776633/199008328-d55d8547-28e7-45f2-a328-7b000ee17a5f.png)

We get a 200 reponse code, and a response body stating "5 $20 notes dispensed. 2 $50 notes dispensed."

All other requests follow the same process.
